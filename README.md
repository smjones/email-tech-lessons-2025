# email-tech-lessons-2025
**Ways to educate people about email technologies in 2025**

This is a repository for exploring ideas about how to teach beginners the technical fundamentals around email, or how to give them the tools to learn on their own. Starting with proposal.md, this may expand to include other content/ideas as they develop. (Or not - I'm creating this now to make it easy to share the proposal, we'll see if anything happens...)
